This directory is started in April, 2014 to sort out the leftover of the EOS project.

See the description in diatomics.pro

KP = Chemical Equilibrium Constant for pressure
PF  = Partition Function
EINT  = Internal Energy

Sources:                 Data:        Derived:        Molecules:
Vardya (1961, 1965)      KP, EINT                     H2, H2+
Sauval & Tatum (1987)    PF, KP       EINT            294 (all diatomics)
Irwin (1981, 1987)       PF           KP, EINT        H2, CO
Tsuji (1973)             KP                           127 diatomics (+ some polys)
Bohn & Wolf (1984)       PF           KP, EINT        H2, CO
Kurucz (1985)            N/A


molecular identifications (for each molecule):

name = 'H2+'
nc = 2 ; number of constituents
nuc = 1 ; number of unique constituents
constituents = ['H', 'H']
charge = +1
code = '101.01'

data:
d0 = 4.4781
ma = m(H)*m(H)/(m(H)+m(H))

I sorted all the catalogues and saved them as catalogue_of_diatomics.sav. See
make_catalogue_of_diatomics.pro in make_catalogue directory. 

The data from Sauval and Tatum is saved as sauvalandtatum1984_eqc.sav and
sauvalandtatum1984_pf.sav.
