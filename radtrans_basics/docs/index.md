## Radiative transfer basics in IDL

This repository contains various routines useful for developing radiative transfer code in IDL. Due to synthax similarity between IDL and Fortran, it is almost trivial to port them to Fortran. 

### Legendre polynomials

Legendre polynomials are used to construct quadrature (i.e. to select angles and their weights) for integrals in 1D solvers of RTE.

### Kourganoff plots

### Exponential integrals
